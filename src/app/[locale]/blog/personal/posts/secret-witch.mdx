SOOOOOOOOOO, today I discovered this new anime called *Secrets of the Silent Witch* (サイレント・ウィッチ 沈黙の魔女の隠しごと), and I'm happy to say it got me back to being in love with series. I'm not an expert when it comes to reviewing media, but I do have beautiful things to say about this anime. Everything — the story, the art, the songs, and the atmosphere it creates, it all amazed me. I just had to get my thoughts out about it here.

It even has nods to chess, which I’ve been falling in love with lately, but it also avoids something that usually exhausts me in anime: characters loudly announcing every power, enchantment, or technique they’re about to use. I know it’s part of the genre and can be fun for some people, but it just gets old for me pretty fast. Here, though, *Monica Everett*, the protagonist, is so shy that she had to learn how to cast spells silently. I might be over-exaggerating, but I absolutely love that. Not hearing spell names lets me focus so much more on the story, and I LOVE THAT.

## The Animation
THIS is one of the strongest points of this anime for me. I love how the series isn’t the most effect-heavy, yet the love and care put into the characters’ expressions is beautiful. They make me happy, and I’m glad for that.  

I haven’t been super into anime lately, but I like to think I’ve always been close to it through its music, which is what I listen to the most. This anime feels like I’m finally getting the missing piece that complements my music taste with a visually stunning world full of beautiful stories.

AAAAAAAhhhh, okay, enough yapping :p
